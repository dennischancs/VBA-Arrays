# VBA-Arrays
Custom Arrays in class module, that have similar functions as JavaScript. Example: Push, Pop, Shift, Unshift, Sort, map, length, concat,  toString.

*Currently working on a version that has support for multi dim arrays!! Adding funtions to query & sort them. If interested, check it out!!

# Properties:
- value
- lenght

# Public Funtions:
- push
- pop
- shift
- unshift
- filter
- map
- forEach
- reduce
- exists
- concat
- sort
- reverse
- toString
- toRange
- columnNumber
- returnColumn
- returnRow

# Private Helper Funtions:
- arrayFromCollection
- asign
- collectionToMultiDimArray
- collectionFromarray
- dimensionLength
- isSingleDimension
- array2dUnshift
- sqlArray

# Usage

Must import file for Property Value to be set as the class default.
No extra refrences to other libriaries needed at this time.

Below is a test module, that shows some of the functions, and how to work with them. (Orginal, need to add new arrayObject examples)

```vb
'==============================================================================
' NOTES: CURRENTLY THIS CLASS IS IN THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES. TESTING IS STILL
' GOING ON, AS WELL AS ADDING MORE FUNCTIONS. 
'==============================================================================
Private Sub testClassArrays()
  
    Dim A As New cArray
    Dim standardArray As Variant 'USED FOR TESTING
    
    
    'ADD VALUES TO END OF CLASS ARRAY
    A.push "apple"
    A.push "bannana"
    
    
    'REMOVE VALUES FROM END OF CLASS ARRAY (RETURNS ITEM REMOVED(BANNANA))
    Debug.Print A.pop
    
    
    'ADD VALUES TO THE START OF THE CLASS ARRAY
    A.unshift "bannana"
    A.unshift "mango"
    
    
    'REMOVE VALUES FROM START OF THE ARRAY (RETURNS ITEM REMOVED(MANGO))
    Debug.Print A.shift
    
    
    'CHANGE VALUES BASED ON INDEX (WILL PUSH IF INDEX > UBOUND)(OPTION BASE 0)
    A(1) = "zeebra"
    
    
    'DISPLAY LENGHT OF CLASS ARRAY (ALWAYS ONE MORE THAN THE UBOUND)
    Debug.Print A.length
    A(A.length) = "apple" 'CAN FORCE A PUSH THIS WAY...
    
    
    '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    ' pArray IS THE ARRAY THAT IS STORED IN THE CLASS. IT IS PUBLIC,
    ' SO THAT IT CAN BE ACCESSED AND MANIPULATED OR USED IN DIFF WAYS.
    '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    
    'AT THIS POINT YOU ARE WORKING WITH A NORMAL ARRAY, SO LETS SET IT TO A VAR
    standardArray = A.pArray
    
    'EMPTY OUR CLASS ARRAY, FOR TESTING WE WILL ADD ONE NEW ITEM
    A.EmptyAndRedim
    
    A.push "carrot"
    
    'CONCATE RETURNS THE CURRENT ARRAY JOINED WITH ANOTHER ARRAY.
    'THIS EXAMPLE WILL SET THE pArray = TO CLASS ARRAY JOINED WITH THE STANDARD ARRAY
    A.pArray = A.concat(standardArray)
    
    
    'toString WILL RETURN THE ARRAY JOINED WITH COMMAS
    Debug.Print A.toString
    
    'YOU CAN ALSO SORT
    A.sort
    Debug.Print A.toString
    
    'REVERSING THE ARRAY WILL GIVE YOU DECENDING ORDER
    A.reverse
    Debug.Print A.ToString
    
    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    ' MAPPING WILL USE EXCELS EVALUATE FUNCTION, TO TAKE A STRING AND DO
    ' BASIC FORMULAS TO EACH ITEM IN THE ARRAY, AND RETURN A NEW ARRAY.
    ' EXAMPLE BELOW IS UPPER CASE EACH ITEM. NOTE: {} IS WHERE THE ELEMENT WILL GO.
    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    A.pArray = A.Map("upper({})")
    
    'LETS SEE THE RESULTS USING THE JOIN FUNCTION. (RUNS VBA JOIN FUNCTION)
    Debug.Print A.Join(", ")
    
    'EXAMPLES WITH NUMBERS
    A.EmptyAndRedim
    A.push 1
    A.push 2
    A.push 3
    
    A.pArray = A.Map("SUM(2 * {})")
    
    Debug.Print A.Join(", ")
    
    'FOR EACH LOOPS THROUGH AND CALLS A FUNCTION. A WAY OF DOING A CALLBACK FUNCTION. (NOT SUGGESTED FOR LARGE ARRAYS)
    A.forEach "ArrayForEach"
    
End Sub


'SUB TESTING forEach. Note, this is not the most effective way of looping arrays. Mostly used for on the spot coding..
Public Sub ArrayForEach(Element As Variant)

    Debug.Print Element Is TypeName(Element)
    
End Sub
